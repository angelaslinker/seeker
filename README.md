# SEEKER
Seeker is a game in which the player seeks to find the hider by guessing its location. The hider gives hints until it is found.

## RULES
The hider's location is a random number between 1 and 1000.
The seeker searches for the hider by guessing its location.
If the guess is closer to the hider's location it says, "Getting warmer!"
If the guess is farther away from the hider's location it says, "Getting colder!"
If the guess is correct the hider says, "You found me!". The game is over.
